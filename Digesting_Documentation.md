## Learning Complex Usage
In this challenge they told to access any file i need to invoke /challenge/challenge with --printfile flag with argument as the path, i first tried opening the doc file as mentioned in the instructions, which gave the same instructions set. THn i tried to find all paths conating file named flag using find command, at first i was seeing many paths i was trying thrm but then I saw directly /flag path and then i directly followed the instructions set.
