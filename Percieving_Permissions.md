# Percieving Permissions
This is my nineth module. I dont know much about percieving permissions. Till now its been easy to learn even the new things lets see how this module goes.

## Changing File Ownership
In this challenge I learned to use chown, it is used to change ownership of file, we generally require root access to use chown.
